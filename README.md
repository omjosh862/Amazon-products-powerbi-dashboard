## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps to understand analyze and visualize key aspects of Amazon's sales data including sales performance by product category, customer segment, region, and sales channel. 
Use data analysis and visualization to identify trends, patterns, and insights which can be used to optimize sales strategies and improve profitability.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present except column named "Null".
- Step 5 : For calculating average  product sale, null values were not taken into account as only less than 1% values are null in this column(i.e column named "Product Name") 
- Step 6 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 7 : Since the data contains various ratings, thus in order to represent ratings, a new visual was added using the three ellipses in the visualizations pane in report view. 
- Step 8 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for four fields named "Overall sale", "Sales", "Sales by state and city" & "Time and Total amount".
- Step 9 : Two Slicers image visuals were added to the canvas, one representing Product image with details & other representin.
